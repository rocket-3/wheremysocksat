# #wheremysocksat
Add your **things** on a **map** to *locate* (find) them later. 
A thing can be a **container** (contain other things) that moves all thing inside with it.
Nested things are easy to find.

## Roadmap (TODO)

- [ ] Add some runnable project basis (boilerplate)
- [ ] Specify data model (things and containers relations)
- [ ] Specify how thing are located (address, coords, etc.)
- [ ] Make main actions (add, edit, move, find)
- [ ] Add a map to display thing on (may use Leaflet for example)
- [ ] Make it work with cloud data storage
