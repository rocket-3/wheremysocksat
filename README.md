Add your things on a map to locate (find) them later. 
A thing can be a container (contain other things) that moves all thing inside with it.
Nested things are easy to find.

# Roadmap
1. Specify data model (things and containers relations)
2. Specify how thing are located (address, coords, etc.)
3. Make main actions (add, edit, move, find)
4. Add a map to display thing on (may use Leaflet for example)
5. Make it work with cloud data storage
